# Bybit Trading Bot
This is an example program that would execute inverse future trades according to the hull suite indicator on your Bybit account. I would not recomend using this implementation in real life as the code is neither robust nor  It was meant to be run on a low power compute device continuously.

## To Use
- download all required packages in requirments.txt
- It reads in api keys from a User.xlsx file.
- run with the nohup and "&" flag so that it runs as a background process and continues after you close the terminal.
